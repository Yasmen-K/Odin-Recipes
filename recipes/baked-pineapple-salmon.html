    <h2>Description</h2>
    <p>
      Giving the salmon a quick broil at the end of cooking gives the marinade a
      chance to caramelize—it's too good. Just make sure to keep a close eye on
      it, so you don't overcook the salmon! Two to three minutes is all you need
      under a hot broiler
    </p>

      <li>Freshly ground black pepper</li>
      <li>3 tbsp. melted butter</li>
      <li>3 tbsp. sweet chili sauce</li>
      <li>2 tbsp. freshly chopped cilantro</li>
      <li>3 cloves garlic, minced</li>
      <li>2 tsp. freshly grated ginger</li>
      <li>2 tsp. toasted sesame oil</li>
      <li>1/2 tsp. crushed red pepper flakes</li>
      <li>Toasted sesame seeds, for garnish</li>

    <h4>Steps</h4>
    <ol>
      <li>
        Preheat oven to 350°. Line a large rimmed baking sheet with foil and
        grease with cooking spray. In the center of the foil, lay pineapple
        slices in an even layer.
      </li>
      <li>
        Season both sides of the salmon with salt and pepper and place on top of
        pineapple slices.
      </li>
      <li>
        In a small bowl, whisk together butter, chili sauce, cilantro, garlic,
        ginger, sesame oil, and red pepper flakes. Brush all over salmon fillet.
      </li>
      <li>
        Bake until the salmon is cooked through, about 25 minutes. Switch the
        oven to broil, and broil for 2 minutes, or until fish is slightly
        golden. Garnish with sesame seeds and green onions and serve with lime
        wedges.
