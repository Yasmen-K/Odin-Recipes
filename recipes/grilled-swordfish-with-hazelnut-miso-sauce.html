    <h2>Description</h2>
    <p>
      If you’re freaking out about grilling fish, let me start with a little
      assurance: Swordfish is a sturdy meaty fish that won’t flake out on the
      grill. In fact, it kind of reminds me of chicken breasts. Plus, swordfish
      steaks (how they’re commonly sold) don’t have a delicate skin—the usual
      sticky culprit. All you need is a hot grill, a sturdy spatula, and some
      confidence.

    <h3>Ingredients</h3>
    <ul>
      <li>2 6- to 8- ounce swordfish steaks (about 1-inch thick)</li>
      <li>2 tbsp. extra-virgin olive oil, divided</li>
      <li>1/2 tsp. kosher salt, divided</li>
      <li>1/2 tsp. freshly ground black pepper, divided</li>
      <li>6 shallots, peeled and halved</li>
      <li>6 radishes, halved</li>
      <li>3 tbsp. unsalted butter</li>
      <li>1 tbsp. sesame seeds</li>
      <li>1/3 c. blanched unsalted hazelnuts, lightly crushed</li>
      <li>2 tbsp. shiro miso</li>
      <li>1 tbsp. maple syrup</li>
      <li>1 tsp. toasted sesame oil</li>
      <li>1 clove garlic, grated</li>
    </ul>

    <h4>Steps</h4>
    <ol>
      <li>
        Preheat grill to high heat. Season swordfish steaks with 1 tbsp. olive oil and 1/4 tsp. each salt and black pepper. Grill until golden brown on both sides and fairly firm to the touch, 8 to 10 minutes total. Transfer to serving platter. 
      </li>
      <li>
        In a large bowl, toss shallots and radishes with 1 tbsp. olive oil and 1/4 tsp. each salt and black pepper. Grill, cut-side down until lightly charred and tender, 6 to 8 minutes. Transfer to serving platter. 
      </li>
      <li>
        Make sauce: Heat a small saucepan over medium high heat (or place it right on outdoor grill). Add butter, sesame seeds, and hazelnuts. Stir often until nuts are a deep golden brown, about 10 minutes. Remove from heat and stir in miso, maple syrup, sesame oil, garlic, and 2 tbsp. water. Spoon all over swordfish and veg to serve.
